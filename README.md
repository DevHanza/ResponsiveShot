# ResponsiveShot
ResponsiveShot is a Python-based tool that automates capturing responsive screenshots of websites across various device sizes. 
Built with PyScript, it's designed to help web developers — especially early-career devs — save time, preserve their work, and showcase it beautifully in portfolios or job applications.
